How it works?

  * Start: Login with your Google Account(Sorry but we have to save your email in our system).
  * Add Feeds: Provide your activity rss feeds from flickr, last.fm, del.icio.us, blog or any other publically visible feeds(we don't really wanna invade into private feeds).
  * No social element: Send your public url among friends by email, skype or whatever?
